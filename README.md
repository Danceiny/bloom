Bloom filters with redis backend

Port <https://github.com/willf/bloom> to redis backend

>related test case should be passed, please see [bloom_test.TestBasicRedisBloomFilter](bloom_test.go).

**Difference**

|bloom (by willf)|go.bloom (by Danceiny)|
|---|---|
|API: `bloom.New`|renamed to API: `bloom.NewMemoryBloomFilter`|
|no persistence backend|support persistence backend interface, and redis backend provided already|

You can implement `Storage` interface by yourself, enjoy it.

```
type Storage interface {
	Set(offset uint)
	FlushSet() error
	PrepareSet() error
	Test(offset uint) (bool, error)
}
```

A Bloom filter is a representation of a set of _n_ items, where the main
requirement is to make membership queries; _i.e._, whether an item is a
member of a set.

A Bloom filter has two parameters: _m_, a maximum size (typically a reasonably large multiple of the cardinality of the set to represent) and _k_, the number of hashing functions on elements of the set. (The actual hashing functions are important, too, but this is not a parameter for this implementation). A Bloom filter is backed by a [BitSet](https://github.com/Danceiny/bitset); a key is represented in the filter by setting the bits at each value of the  hashing functions (modulo _m_). Set membership is done by _testing_ whether the bits at each value of the hashing functions (again, modulo _m_) are set. If so, the item is in the set. If the item is actually in the set, a Bloom filter will never fail (the true positive rate is 1.0); but it is susceptible to false positives. The art is to choose _k_ and _m_ correctly.

In this implementation, the hashing functions used is [murmurhash](github.com/spaolacci/murmur3), a non-cryptographic hashing function.

This implementation accepts keys for setting and testing as `[]byte`. Thus, to
add a string item, `"Love"`:

    n := uint(1000)
    filter := bloom.New(20*n, 5) // load of 20, 5 keys
    filter.Add([]byte("Love"))

Similarly, to test if `"Love"` is in bloom:

    if filter.Test([]byte("Love"))

For numeric data, I recommend that you look into the encoding/binary library. But, for example, to add a `uint32` to the filter:

    i := uint32(100)
    n1 := make([]byte, 4)
    binary.BigEndian.PutUint32(n1, i)
    filter.Add(n1)

Finally, there is a method to estimate the false positive rate of a particular
bloom filter for a set of size _n_:

    if filter.EstimateFalsePositiveRate(1000) > 0.001

Given the particular hashing scheme, it's best to be empirical about this. Note
that estimating the FP rate will clear the Bloom filter.
